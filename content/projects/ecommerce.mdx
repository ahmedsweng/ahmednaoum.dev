## About The Project

Based on tutorial by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodingwithBasir"><strong> Code With Basir » </strong></a>

I realized that I wanted to take my learning to the next level by adding TypeScript support and integrating a UI library to make my application more visually appealing.

To accomplish this, I decided to use Shadcn UI, a modern and responsive UI library for Tailwindcss. I was impressed with the simplicity and ease of use of this library, as well as its extensive documentation and community support.

Adding TypeScript support to my application was also a rewarding experience. It helped me catch errors early on in the development process and made my code more readable and maintainable.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience for me. It allowed me to build upon the skills I gained from the tutorial and challenge myself by incorporating new technologies. I look forward to continuing to develop my skills and exploring new tools and technologies in the future.
